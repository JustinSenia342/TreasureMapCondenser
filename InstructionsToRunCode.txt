It was completed around 6:15pm, I just wanted to make sure that I wrote some detailed instructions for running everything (so that took an extra few minutes).


- System Configuration -

Used the following JDK: jdk1.8.0_231

Installer for that JDK: jdk-8u231-windows-x64.exe 
Link: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

The following environment variables are set in my version of Windows:
JAVA_HOME = C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_231
JDK_HOME = C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_231

The following were added to my System path:
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_231\bin
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_231\jre\bin




- To Run the program - 
The Project root folder is called "TreasureMapCondenser" (the folder structure is based on MAVEN, with the packages divided up in the ".\TreasureMapCondenser\src\main\java\tmapcondenser\" directory").

All you should need to do is run the "TreasureMapCondenserGui.java" (I compiled/ran everything just fine through visual studio code).

That file is located here: .\TreasureMapCondenser\src\main\java\tmapcondenser\gui\TreasureMapCondenserGui.java

The rest of the instructions on how to use it are included in the program (it also can generate it's own treasure maps based on user provided criteria for # of steps)



Please let me know if you have any trouble running it, aside from random system configuration problems it should work very well for what it's intended to do (I spent a lot of time on it, and tested the heck out of it).
